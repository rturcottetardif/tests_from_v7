Some basics checks for new processing

basicChecks.py looks if the important keys are filled and if the value make sense
gettingRoisAndTimes.py saves a file with the ROIs and the time for many files
plottingRoisAndTimes.py plots the ROIs and rate in a meaninful fashion

To do, check waveforms... Ideas: look at the baselines, look at the spectrum, look at the number of corrupted bins.... etc
